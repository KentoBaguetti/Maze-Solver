# Maze Solving Visualizer

BFS and Backtracking algorithms

Visualizer built with the matplotlib library

In order to run the visualizer, clone the repo and then run the main.py file. <br>
Once running, enter into the terminal which algorithm you want to view, the choices will be printed in the terminal. <br>
The non-visual algorithms will print the paths they found in a from a list. The visual ones will visually display the paths it found on the maze.
